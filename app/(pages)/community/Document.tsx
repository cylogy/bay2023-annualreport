                  The Community Advisory Council (CAC), consisting of 17 members
                  from across the Bay Area, was created in 2021 to advise our
                  leadership on community-related matters, advance an
                  equity-forward policy agenda, and provide input on key
                  policies and programs. In 2023, the CAC recommended, and our
                  Board approved, the CACâ€™s foundational documents: the
                  Community Advisory Council Charter and the Community Advisory
                  Council Compensation Policy and Procedures. The Board also
                  approved the Resolution Establishing a Governance Structure
                  for the Community Advisory Council. The CAC ad hoc committees
                  developed an annual work plan and environmental justice policy
                  goals for integration into our strategic plan. In September,
                  the CAC held its inaugural retreat, an event focused on

                    We secured a $1 million grant from the US EPAâ€™s Climate
                    Pollution Reduction Grant Program to lead the development of
                    a regional climate action plan that incorporates input from
                    and reflects the priorities of the regionâ€™s local
                    governments and communities. The plan will highlight{' '}
                    <span className="font-bold">
                      priority greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction measures that
                      benefit frontline communities â€” communities that are
                      marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution.
                    </span>{' '}
                    Measures included in the plan will be eligible for
                    nationally competitive $4.6 billion in implementation
                    funding. We are leading this effort in collaboration with a
                    regional advisory work group, consisting of staff from Bay
                    Area regional agencies and local governments.
