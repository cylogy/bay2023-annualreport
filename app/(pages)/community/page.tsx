              policy agenda, and provide input on key policies and programs. In

              foundational documents: the Community Advisory Council Charter and
              the Community Advisory Council Compensation Policy and Procedures.
              The Board also approved the Resolution Establishing a Governance
              Structure for the Community Advisory Council. The CAC ad hoc
              committees developed an annual work plan and environmental justice
              policy goals for integration into our strategic plan. In
